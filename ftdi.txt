Mode2 receive/transmit driver for FTDI-based devices.
=====================================================

Mode2 receiver + transmitter using the bitbang mode of an FTDI
USB-to-serial chip such as the FT232R, with a demodulating IR receiver
connected to one of the FTDI chip's data pins -- by default, D1 (RXD).

The driver expects a --device specification which is comma-separated list
of key-value pairs e. g.,

    --device=serial=A4001doI,input=7

All settings are optional, and have reasonable defaults.

| Key     | Value                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| vendor  | Vendor code (default 0x0403 for FTDI)      |
| product | Product code (default 0x6001 for FT232)    |
| desc    | Description string (default = not defined) |
| serial  | Serial string (default = not defined)      |
| input   | Input bit number (0..7, default = 1)       |
| output  | See input                                  |
| baud    | To be determined                           |
| txbaud  | To be determined                           |


Dependencies
------------

Building this driver requires lirc v 0.9.3+. You need the header files,
the unversioned dynamic libraries and the pkg-config support (.pc
filed). Typically, this lives in a package called lirc-devel.

The build also requires the libftdi library [1]. This is packaged
in some distributions; typically you should install libftdi-level.


Build, install and check
------------------------

With dependencies in place the build is trivial:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The makefile respects CFLAGS and LDFLAGS if they are set in the environment
during the build.

After the installation, check the results using lirc-lsplugins:

    $ lirc-lsplugins ftdi
    ftdi                -as   /usr/lib64/lirc/plugins/ftdi.so


Adding the *--long* option gives more info on the driver.
